 In the war-ravaged land of The Basin, the League of Arathor and the Defilers have fought for five long years over precious resources and control. As dark forces manipulate events from the shadows, hope for peace seems distant. Embark on a thrilling adventure to uncover hidden intentions, navigate shifting alliances, and strive for lasting peace in this epic tale of courage, wit, and determination.
