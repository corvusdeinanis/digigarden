# HiðŸŒ±
This is my Digital Garden. I publish all my notes so that you can roam them.
I will probably abandon this site as most of my projects collect dust after a while.



To get started, here is a list of my projects:

## Promises of Victory
![Pasted image 20230329230847.png](/img/user/resources/Pictures/Pasted%20image%2020230329230847.png)

 In the war-ravaged land of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]], the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/League of Arathor/League of Arathor\|League of Arathor]] and the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Defilers/Defilers\|Defilers]] have fought for five long years over precious resources and control. As dark forces manipulate events from the shadows, hope for peace seems distant. Embark on a thrilling adventure to uncover hidden intentions, navigate shifting alliances, and strive for lasting peace in this epic tale of courage, wit, and determination.

> [!warning] If you want to play this Campain. GO AWAY! There are heavy spoilers in those Documents. A Safe Introduction is still TODO

Things you could start with:
- To get hooked: [[Promises of Victory/General/Primer\|Primer]]
- To get a overview of the Story as a GM [[Promises of Victory/Adventuring/Structure of the Campain\|Structure of the Campain]]
- To get started as a GM: [[Promises of Victory/General/Starting the Adventure\|Starting the Adventure]]
