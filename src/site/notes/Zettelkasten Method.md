German for "slip box"

popularized by **Niklas Luhmann**, a prolific German sociologist who built up a _Zettelkasten_ of ~ 90,000 index cards for his research. He published 50 books and 550 articles.

It is making atomic notes (small notes that work individually), writing permanent notes, and then linking notes. You don't classify notes and restrict them to a category or a folder. This helps because it takes off the  blinders on our horses and helps us look at the bigger picture. 

inspired software such as Notecards which inspired the invention of wikis!
