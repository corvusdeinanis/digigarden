_The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test_ - 1968 nonfiction book by Tom Wolfe
>
>*The book presents a firsthand account of the experiences of Ken Kesey and his band of Merry Pranksters, who traveled across the United States in a colorfully-painted school bus, Furthur, whose name was painted on the destination sign, indicating the general ethos of the Pranksters. Kesey and the Pranksters became famous for their use of psychedelic drugs (such as LSD) to achieve expansion of their consciousness. The book chronicles the Acid Tests (parties with LSD-laced Kool-Aid), encounters with notable figures of the time (Hells Angels, Grateful Dead, Allen Ginsberg), and describes Kesey's exile to Mexico and his arrests.*
