Thinking
-   Analyzing acquired and existing info
-   Manipulation of mental representations of information
-   Cognitive process

Nature of thinking
-   Cannot be observed, only inferred through overt behaviour
-   Internal process
-   Abstracting, reasoning
-   Goal-oriented
-   Organized

Building Blocks of Thought
	Think in terms of mental images or words
foundation of thought:
- Mental images  
- concepts  

Concepts
Understand an object by extracting char and matching with already existing categories.
Mental representation of categories.  Refers to class of objects, ideas and events that have commonalities.                                                                                 

Mental Image
-   Visual imagery, seeing from mind's eye
-   Mental representation of sensory experience
-   Things, places and events

Need for concept -
Concept formation helps organize knowledge
Easier to access existing knowledge, less time and effort
Quick and efficient
Eg – like a library

Processes of Thinking
1.  Problem Solving
2.  Reasoning
3.  Decision Making
4.  Creative Thinking

Problem Solving
Goal oriented
Problem =/= obstacles. Any activity with goal
Day to day activity
Initial state – Problem
End State – Goal

Several steps in bw -> Mental operations

Mental Operations in Problem Solving -
1.  Identifying problem
2.  Represent the problem
3.  Plan Solution
4.  Evaluate solutions
5.  Select one solution
6.  Evaluate outcome
7.  Rethink and redefine

Factors affecting problem solving
- Expertise – good memory of elements, form mental images and representations that help prob sol. Relate to similar prob. Efficient methods. Parallel processing, not serial processing.
- Mental Set – Approaching new prob with same approach that helped solve similar problem. Help us generally. Sometimes similarity is illusionary therefore misleads us
- Insight – Sudden perception of relation of elements of perceptual field. 'Aha experience'.
- Incubation – Solution suddenly appears when we stand back from problem
- Functional Fixedness – Tendency to think of object in terms of its familiar functions or name. Thinking in one way. Similar to mental set because does not let us use familiar objects in novel way. Duncker's candle problem (tacks, candle, matches)

Reasoning
It is a cognitive process where we transforms info to arrive at specific conclusion and make decisions. Formal and everyday reasoning

Formal Reasoning
Have all reqd info. Usually only one solution. Direct/ straightforward
aka syllogistic reasoning

Everyday Reasoning
Complex, multiple solutions, req planning and evaluating, etc
Less definite

Inductive Reasoning
No absolute conclusions. Derived from experience. May not be logical. Used in daily life
e.g.  Shrimp get cramps. Maybe cramps from shrimps?

Deductive Reasoning
Conclusion must be true if premise is true. Premises = basic info that allow people to draw conclusions

Analogy
4 parts, first two parts and last two parts have similar relation. Partial similarity among things that are diff in other ways
e.g. water : fish :: air : humans

Help identify and visualize salient attributes

Problem Solving
Immediate perception + info from long term memory

                         Algorithms and Heuristics

Algorithm  - rule that when applied guarantees a solution to the problem. Can be used even if we don't know how it works. Right formula = Right solution

Heuristics - shortcuts used to simplify and solve a problem. Do not guarantee a solution. But when they work, offer rapid solution.

Means-end-analysis

Decision Making
A kind of problem-solving where one solution must be chosen from a number of alternatives.

Factors that affect Decision Making
1.  Heuristics - Rigid and efficient manner. Rule of thumbs. Derived from past experience
2.  Framing - Presentation of information in terms of gains and losses. Emphasis on gain people preferred to avoid risk. Preferred risk over losses. Influences type of choice we make.
3.  Escalation of Commitment - Tendency to become committed to bad decisions even as losses increase. Trapped in bad decisions.

Creative Thinking
-   Production of novel and original ideas or solutions to problems
-   But has to have purpose
-   Unique ideas that did not exist before
-   Just non-conformist and bizarre =/= creative thinking
-   Reality-oriented, appropriate, constructive, socially desirable

JP GUILFORD - Two types of thinking
Convergent  
Only one solution, direct and straightforward

Divergent  
Open-ended thinking, in terms of their experience. Helps produce novel ideas

Divergent thinking includes :-
1.  Fluency - many ideas for one task
2.  Flexibility - Variety in thinking
3.  Originality - Unusual, novelty
4.  Elaboration - Going into details
