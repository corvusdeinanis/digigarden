[[Promises of Victory/1. General/Things/The Plague\|The Plague]] was a necrotic virus that was spread by the necromancer [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Defilers/General Malachi\|Malachi]]. It caused the recently deceased to rise from the dead as zombies with their souls still affixed to them. [[Promises of Victory/1. General/Things/The Plague\|The Plague]] caused a great divide in [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/2. Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]], with many people seeing the undead as monsters. The [[Promises of Victory/2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/League of Arathor/League of Arathor\|League of Arathor]] to this day sees the undead as the same monsters that killed many of their kin.
