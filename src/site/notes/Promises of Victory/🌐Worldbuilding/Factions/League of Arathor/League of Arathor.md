The League of Arathor is a coalition of mostly humans that formed to fight back against the undead legions of the [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Defilers/Defilers\|Defilers]]. The League is led by [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/League of Arathor/High Paladin Erathenar\|High Paladin Erathenar]], a human paladin from the city of [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Regions/Todo/Trollbans Hold\|Trollbans Hold]].
The League's troops are mostly made up of human and elf paladins and archers, with a small number of dwarven warriors. They are well-equipped and highly trained, but they are outnumbered by the [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Defilers/Defilers\|Defilers]]' forces.
The Codex of the League of Arathor dictates that all members must fight to defend life and uphold justice. The paladins of the League are known for their bravery and righteousness, and they will stop at nothing to vanquish the [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Defilers/Defilers\|Defilers]] from [[🌐Skoria/🌐Worldbuilding/Material Plane/🏞️The Basin/The Basin\|The Basin]].
