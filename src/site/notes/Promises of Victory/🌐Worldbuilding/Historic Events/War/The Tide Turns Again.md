The [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/League of Arathor/League of Arathor\|League of Arathor]] fought back, and they regained control of the Desecrated Stronghold. This gave them a major advantage, and they began to push the [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Defilers/Defilers\|Defilers]] back.
