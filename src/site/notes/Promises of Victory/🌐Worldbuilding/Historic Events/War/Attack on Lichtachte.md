The initial attack on [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Regions/🏰Lichtachte/Lichtachte\|Lichtachte]] occurred in the year 3014. The attackers were a horde of zombies. The zombies overwhelmed the city's defenses, and many people were killed. To regain the casualties [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Defilers/General Malachi\|Malachi]] spread her Plague to rescue the citizens. This is what caused the great divide in [[🌐Skoria/🌐Worldbuilding/Material Plane/🏞️The Basin/The Basin\|The Basin]]. 
# Behind the Scenes
