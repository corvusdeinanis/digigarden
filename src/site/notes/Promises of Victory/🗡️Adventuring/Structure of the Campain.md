give a description on how the players can find out about the true origins of the Shaddowhammer
The origins of The Shaddowhammer can be unveiled through a series of clues, hidden documents, and the testimonies of key figures involved in the cult or who have had dealings with it. In order to uncover the truth behind the cult, players will need to follow a trail of breadcrumbs that will lead them from one piece of information to another, eventually revealing the full picture.

### Discovering Clues

Throughout their journey in [[🌐Skoria/🌐Worldbuilding/Material Plane/🏞️The Basin/The Basin\|The Basin]], players may come across various hints and pieces of information that could lead them towards discovering more about The Shaddowhammer. These clues can be found in:

1. Ancient texts or scrolls detailing The Shaddowhammer's beginnings.
2. Hidden messages or symbols left by former members who have defected from the cult.
3. Conversations with NPCs who have interacted with or heard rumors about The Shaddowhammer's activities.

> [!seed] Seed, Adventure Hook
> Players discover an old journal belonging to a member of The Shaddowhammer that contains cryptic references to the cult's origins and its connection to [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]].

### Key Figures

Players may encounter several key figures throughout their adventure who can shed light on The Shaddowhammer's origins:

- **Volar**: As the leader of The Shaddowhammer, Volar possesses intimate knowledge about its beginnings and ultimate goals. Players may have opportunities to confront Volar directly or overhear conversations revealing vital information.

- **The Gifted**: Some members of The Gifted may be aware of their connection to The Shaddowhammer and [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]]. Interrogating or befriending these individuals could provide valuable insights into how the two groups are intertwined.

- **Iraia and Edard Combell**: As founding members of [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Cult of the Gifted/The Gifted\|The Gifted]], they know much about how it all started, but might not reveal everything as they seek to protect their own interests.

- **Tarwin Althammer**: If players can uncover Tarwin's tragic past, they may learn about his connection to The Shaddowhammer and its influence on his life.

> [!tip] GM Tip, Hint, Important
> Use the key figures and their motivations to craft encounters that challenge the players' assumptions and force them to piece together the truth.

### Unveiling The Truth

As players gather more information about The Shaddowhammer's origins, they will begin to see the manipulative hand of [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]] behind it all. They may also discover the cult's connection to Ilsensine - an ancient being whose influence may have shaped the path of The Shaddowhammer.

To fully expose the truth behind The Shaddowhammer, players must confront Volar and reveal his deception. This climactic confrontation might take place at the cult's hidden base in Shadowspire or during a crucial moment when their plans are nearing completion.

Through persistence and clever investigation, players will finally uncover the true origins of The Shaddowhammer: a dark cult born from ancient forces seeking to manipulate mortals into unwittingly serving their sinister agendas.

## Origin of the [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Things/Stoalium\|Stoalium]]

All over the lands of [[🌐Skoria/🌐Worldbuilding/Material Plane/🏞️The Basin/The Basin\|The Basin]] you can find round tubical Caves that go deeper and deeper into the earth. In those Caves you can find a metal called [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Things/Stoalium\|Stoalium]] that sits bare in the center of the cave and is anchored through little tendrils to the wall of the cave.

In short, who controls the [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Things/Stoalium\|Stoalium]] supplies, has the upper hand in the Battle for [[🌐Skoria/🌐Worldbuilding/Material Plane/🏞️The Basin/The Basin\|The Basin]]. Because of that, for both sides, Controlling the [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Regions/Todo/Mines of Torrar\|Mines of Torrar]], [[🌐Skoria/🌐Worldbuilding/Material Plane/🏞️The Basin/Regions/Herbstbog/Herbstbog\|Herbstbog]] and [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Regions/🏰Edschmied/Edschmied\|Edschmied]] is the Key to Wining the war.

In Reality [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Things/Stoalium\|Stoalium]] is the remans of the nerves of [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]] and the power bolstering properties wear off at the most Critical Moment.
This leads to the endless war going back and fourth. With one party pushing right to the enemy's gate, but then loosing by a sudden turn of events.

The party can learn, that the [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Things/Stoalium\|Stoalium]] is the reason for this unending loop, that they can use to end the conflict once and for all.

## Adventure Hook Plots
Those are starting Adventures that could get your group hooked into the Events of the Campain: 

> [!seed] The Missing Princess
The party is hired to find the missing princess [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Darkspear Trolls/Jaloren\|Jaloren]] from the [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Regions/Todo/Echo Isles\|Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Regions/Todo/Echo Isles]]. As they follow her trail, they uncover her connection to the dark cult of [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/The Shaddowhammer\|The Shaddowhammer]]. They must rescue [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Darkspear Trolls/Jaloren\|Jaloren]] and unravel the secrets behind her disappearance, leading them deeper into the conflict between the [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/League of Arathor/League of Arathor\|League of Arathor]] and the [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Defilers/Defilers\|Defilers]], as well as discovering the true intentions of [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/The Shaddowhammer\|The Shaddowhammer]].

> [!seed] Artifact Retrieval
The party is tasked with retrieving one of the powerful artifacts (Heart of the Forest, [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Things/Tear of the Archdevil\|Tear of the Archdevil]], or [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Things/Sundawn\|Sundawn]]) for a mysterious benefactor. As they acquire and deliver the artifact, they slowly learn about its connection to ancient rituals and dark powers. This knowledge leads them on a quest to discover more about these artifacts and their potential consequences if used by those who seek to harness their power.

> [!seed] A Call to Arms
The party is recruited by either the [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/League of Arathor/League of Arathor\|League of Arathor]] or [[Promises of Victory/🌐Worldbuilding/Factions/Defilers/Defilers\|Defilers]] (depending on their alignment) to help in their ongoing war against each other.
