| **The Resurrection of Nar’run** |     | **Name:** Dr Phalando |

**Race:** Half-Elf

**Class:** Wizard (School of Divination)

**Background:** Sage (Researcher)

**Alignment:** Neutral Good

**Faction:** None

**Appearance:** Dr Phalando is a middle-aged half-elf with long, silver hair tied back in a loose ponytail. He has a sharp, angular face accentuated by high cheekbones and a pointed chin. His eyes are an icy blue, always seeming to be scanning his surroundings, as if looking for something that others cannot see. He typically wears plain gray robes adorned with various pockets filled with scrolls and small tools. Around his neck hangs a silver pendant in the shape of an eye.

**Personality Traits:**

- Reveres knowledge above all else and seeks out any opportunity to learn more about the world
- Has an unquenchable curiosity that often leads him to ask questions others might find intrusive or uncomfortable
- Prefers to observe situations from afar before becoming directly involved

**Bonds:**

- Fiercely dedicated to his research and will go to great lengths to protect it
- Feels responsible for keeping dangerous artifacts, such as the [[Promises of Victory/General/Storys/Artifact of Chaos\|Artifact of Chaos]], out of the wrong hands
- Has a close relationship with the people of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/🏰Falk/Falk\|Falk]], who appreciate his wisdom and guidance

**Flaws:**

- Can become so absorbed in his studies that he neglects other responsibilities or personal relationships
- Sometimes overestimates his own abilities, leading him to take risks that put himself or others in danger
- Can be dismissive of those he perceives as less intelligent or knowledgeable than himself

**Role in the Campaign:**

Dr Phalando serves as an important source of information for the party throughout their adventures in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]]. As an expert on ancient artifacts and magical phenomena, he is well-equipped to provide insight into any strange occurrences the party may encounter. When the party brings him the [[Promises of Victory/General/Storys/Artifact of Chaos\|Artifact of Chaos]], he recognizes its immense power and potential for destruction and refuses to take it, instead instructing the party to keep it safe and out of the hands of those who would use it for evil.

While Dr Phalando's primary concern is his research, he is not averse to lending his divination abilities to assist the party in their endeavors. However, his assistance often comes with a price – as a seeker of knowledge, he usually asks that the party bring him any intriguing artifacts or information they come across in their travels.

**Quests and Plot Hooks:**

- Dr Phalando could send the party on a quest to recover an ancient tome that contains information vital to his research. The tome might be located in a dangerous dungeon or guarded by powerful creatures.
- The wizard might ask the party to investigate a series of magical disturbances occurring in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/🏰Falk/Falk\|Falk]]. These disturbances could be tied to an enemy faction seeking control over the [[Promises of Victory/General/Storys/Artifact of Chaos\|Artifact of Chaos]].
- If Dr Phalando becomes aware of another powerful artifact or source of knowledge, he may enlist the party's help in securing it before it falls into the wrong hands.

**Relationships with Other NPCs:**

Dr Phalando has cultivated many relationships throughout [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/🏰Falk/Falk\|Falk]] and beyond due to his status as a respected scholar and sage. While some may find his intense curiosity off-putting or intrusive, most appreciate his dedication to preserving knowledge and keeping dangerous artifacts out of harm's way.

As such, Dr Phalando has connections with various individuals who share his passion for research or have sought out his guidance in times of need. One such connection is with [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Dr Phalando\|Dr Phalando]]'s mentor from years past, who could serve as another ally for the party in their adventures within [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]].
