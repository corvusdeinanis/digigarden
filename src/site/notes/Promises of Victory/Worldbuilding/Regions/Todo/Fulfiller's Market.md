[[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/The Fulfiller\|The Fulfiller]]'s Market is a traveling market that goes from town to town. It is a dark and foreboding place, with a feeling of unease. People are subconsciously drawn to the market, where they are then preyed upon by [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/The Fulfiller\|The Fulfiller]].

The market is made up of tents and stalls, with each one selling something different. There are tents for food, drink, weapons, armor, and other various items. But the most important tent is the one that sells dreams. This is where [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/The Fulfiller\|The Fulfiller]] makes her deals.
