### The Truth

The murder 5 years ago was commited by Lambrecht, a researcher of the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/LPF/League of Paranormal Researchers\|LPF]] that poisoned the child to provoke the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Nosem/Nosem\|Nosem]] to show up. The [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Nosem/Nosem\|Nosem]] did not show up, as the child did not have strong unfulfilled ambitions, she already did rise to fame, but was getting tired of playing her instrument.

### Investigating the cold case

Since the murder is cold for 5 years now, it is very hard to find clues. The party used their abilities to find Lambrecht whereabouts. The party can find a listing in documents of the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/LPF/League of Paranormal Researchers\|LPF]]:
"Reyala Althammer - no signs of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Nosem/Nosem\|Nosem]] - right after death - Hawk"
Hawk is the coverup name of Lambrecht, which can be found out by interrogating other members of the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/LPF/League of Paranormal Researchers\|LPF]].
Once the party has found out Lambrecht's real name, they can track him down and confront him.
