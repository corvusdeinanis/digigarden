[[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/üè∞Gandmuehl/Gandmuehl\|Gandmuehl]] is a small town of 2000 people mostly populated by elves.
Most of the people live from forestry, but in the recent years, Gandmuehl rose in popularity from a famous bread manufactured in a bakery inside Gandmuehl. This is also heavly marketed throughout the town.
This divides the population of the town into two groups. One that wants to keep on trading wood and the other one wanting to expand tourism.
The town is in the middle of a cultural change, as the elves that have lived there for generations as lumberman are now being forced to adapt to the new world. The bakery has brought in a lot of new people, and the old ways of life are slowly being forgotten. This has caused a lot of tension between the two groups, and it is slowly tearing the town apart.

## Politics

The town is governed by a council of elves, with the head of the council being the mayor. The council is evenly split between those who want to keep the town's focus on forestry, and those who want to expand tourism. This has caused a lot of infighting and the town is currently in a state of political turmoil.
The two groups name themselfs "The Chuckers" and "The Reformers" witch has led to a lot of resentment between the two groups.
