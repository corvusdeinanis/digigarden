Jaloren is a princess from the  [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/Todo/Echo Isles\|Echo Isles]], known for her beauty and intelligence. She is the sister of [[Promises of Victory/Adventuring/Player Characters/Jamoke\|Jamoke]], a warrior who has been searching for her ever since she went missing under mysterious circumstances. Unknown to [[Promises of Victory/Adventuring/Player Characters/Jamoke\|Jamoke]], Jaloren has become a member of the Rituals of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/The Shaddowhammer\|The Shaddowhammer]], a dark cult that uses powerful magic to manipulate and control others.

The Cult of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/The Shaddowhammer\|The Shaddowhammer]] is notorious for twisting the minds and memories of its members, altering their perceptions to suit their nefarious purposes. In Jaloren's case, they have brainwashed her into believing in their promises by altering her memory to show her a vision of a mass resurrection. This has led Jaloren to become an unwitting accomplice in their evil schemes, gathering soul energy from victims for their rituals.

As part of her duties within the cult, Jaloren was responsible for assassinating her own father when he came close to uncovering their activities. Consumed by guilt and manipulated by the cult's promises, she now seeks to use their dark magic to resurrect him.

In order to find and save his sister, [[Promises of Victory/Adventuring/Player Characters/Jamoke\|Jamoke]] has been using a gemstone that Jaloren left behind as a means of tracking her location.
