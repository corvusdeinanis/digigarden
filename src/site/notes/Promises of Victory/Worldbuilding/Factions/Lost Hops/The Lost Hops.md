All leaders of he Lost Hops have their names erased from memory by magical means. Only the publicly known figures have a fake name that the public Recognizes.

# Structure of the Lost Hops

The Lost Hops are organized into two groups, each led by a captain, called "[[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/Mom\|Mom]]" and "[[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/Dad\|Dad]]". The "Parents" report to [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/Helena\|Helena]], and she gives them their orders.
The group is relatively small, with only around 40 members.

# Founding of the Lost Hops
 The story of the Lost Hops began with the enigmatic [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/Helena\|Helena]]. She was a Changeling Rogue and skilled brewer, who had lived a life of subterfuge and stealth. By chance, she stumbled upon [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/🏰Düsternest/Düsternest\|Düsternest]], an abandoned city in the heart of a deep forest, otherwise known as the Wilds. She took up residence in an old brewery and used it as a base of operations for her new smuggling operation.

[[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/Helena\|Helena]] quickly gained followers who were drawn to her kind and caring demeanor, but also her fierce determination to steal from the rich and provide contraband to the poor. Soon enough, she had organized herself into a large group called the Lost Hops.

One of her first recruits was [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/Uncle\|Uncle]], a Goblin Artificer notorious for selling magical items and counterfeits. He ran a secret shop called “Carl’s Curious Curiosities” out of his home in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/🏰Düsternest/Düsternest\|Düsternest]] that seemed more like an alchemist’s den than an actual store. Although [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/Uncle\|Uncle]] had a good personality and was kind and gentle towards those he saw fit, he could be fierce when necessary - something that appealed to [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/Helena\|Helena]].

[[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/Dad\|Dad]] followed soon after [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/Uncle\|Uncle]]’s arrival. He was an Air Genasi Rogue with an extensive knowledge of lockpicking; specifically, he led his own squad of burglars called their “Sons” who specialized in breaking into homes and shops undetected. All members were named after birds such as Finch, Raven, and Crow in order to better disguise their identities from outsiders.

[[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/Mom\|Mom]] arrived last as the head of logistics. She was a fire genasi artificer with a knack for making magical items and inventions. She quickly formed her own squad of pickpockets and purse snatchers referred to as the “Daughters”, all of which were named after flowers. As a security procedure she invented the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/Ritual of Name\|Ritual of Name]].

The Lost Hops flourished under [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/Helena\|Helena]]’s leadership and [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/🏰Düsternest/Düsternest\|Düsternest]] became their base of operations. Despite their illegal activities, the city guard viewed them as allies due to their good faith efforts, allowing them to continue with their operations in secrecy. With each new recruit, [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/Helena\|Helena]] would conduct a [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/Ritual of Name\|Ritual of Name]], erasing memories of past identities from all members in order to ensure total loyalty to the group. 
 
To this day, the Lost Hops still flourish under [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/Helena\|Helena]]’s leadership and are ever-vigilant in protecting the downtrodden with their secret smuggling operations.

The Lost strongly despise the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/The Triad/The Triad\|The Triad]] because of their Greed and Political influence
