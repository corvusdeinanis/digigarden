Every Member of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|The Lost Hops]] undergoes Moms Ritual of Name. There they lose their name and every memory related to it and are given a new name. With the completion of the ritual, all non magical written evidence of the Person is removed. This way no one can track them or their family back through their real identity. When someone tries to remind them of their past they will forget again in about one minute. Even [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/Mom\|Mom]] doesn't know the real names or origins of her group members.

# Workings of the Ritual
The Ritual name is a powerful combination of Arcane magic and Necromantic magic. The spell touches a persons soul and dividing the Part of its Memory about it self and transfer it towards the Afterlife. The memories sent to the Afterlife are effectively removed from the mortal realm, ensuring that no one can access them. This is especially important for those who have been recruited by [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/Mom\|Mom]], as she does not want anyone to uncover the real identities or origins of those she works with. Storing the memories in the Afterlife also prevents them from being manipulated or distorted and stops any powerful force from using them to their advantage. Furthermore, sending memories to the Afterlife allows for a more peaceful transition, as it eliminates all feelings of guilt and regret which would otherwise be associated with simply erasing a person's past.

# Collecting the lost Memories
In the Afterlife the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Nosem/Nosem\|Nosem]] came across soul fragments containing memories about the souls itself. When they come across some, they store them.  The [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Nosem/Nosem\|Nosem]] carefully and delicately take these memories from the souls, imbuing them with a magical power and a certain life force. 

These memories are then stored in the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/Todo/Floating Towers\|Floating Towers]], great structures filled with ancient artifacts, forgotten myths and powerful secrets. It is here that the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Nosem/Nosem\|Nosem]] keep the secrets of the afterlife, safe from prying eyes.
