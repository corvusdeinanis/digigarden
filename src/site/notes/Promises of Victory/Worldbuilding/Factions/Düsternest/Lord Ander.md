# Involvement with [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Lost Hops/The Lost Hops\|the Lost Hops]]
Lord Ander is aware that the [[Lost Hopps\|Lost Hopps]] operate within Düsternest, and although they may engage in some questionable activities, he recognizes that their goals are ultimately noble and beneficial to the city. As such, he has chosen to provide them with a measure of cover, allowing them to continue their work without interference from the city guard or other authorities.

While Lord Ander does not openly support or endorse the actions of the [[Lost Hopps\|Lost Hopps]], he understands that their presence can be a valuable asset in maintaining balance and addressing issues that might otherwise go unchallenged. This makes for an uneasy alliance between Lord Ander and the Lost Hops, with each party understanding that their goals may sometimes align while also recognizing that they must maintain a certain distance from one another.

> Players could be hired by Lord Ander to investigate a case of corruption within his own administration or perhaps even within the ranks of the city guard. In doing so, they may find themselves working alongside members of the Lost Hops or even being recruited into their ranks.

This delicate relationship between Lord Ander and the [[Lost Hopps\|Lost Hopps]] adds an intriguing layer of complexity to Düsternest's political landscape, providing ample opportunities for intrigue, espionage, and morally ambiguous decisions for players to navigate as they become more involved in the city's affairs. Whether they choose to work with or against either party will ultimately shape their experience in Düsternest and determine where their loyalties truly lie.
