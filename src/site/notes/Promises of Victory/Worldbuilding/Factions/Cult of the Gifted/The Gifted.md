They see him not as an evil force but as a benevolent deity who can grant them their deepest desires in exchange for their devotion.

Members believe that by serving [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]] faithfully and making the necessary sacrifices, they will be rewarded with eternal life or the resurrection of their lost loved ones.

They believe this ritual will not only bring back all those who have died in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|the Basin]] but also revert every undead creature back to its original human form. To achieve this, they need to gather enough Soul energy and construct a massive apparatus somewhere in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|the Basin]] that channels [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]]'s power.

Above them are Preachers who lead congregations in worship and rituals dedicated to [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]].

Higher-ranking members include Elders who oversee multiple congregations within a region, guiding them in their pursuit of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]]'s blessings. The inner circle comprises high-ranking priests known as Fulfillers who act as direct intermediaries between [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]] and his followers, receiving visions and instructions from the god himself.

At the very top are [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Cult of the Gifted/Iraia\|Iraia]] and [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Cult of the Gifted/Edard Combell\|Edard Combell]].

## Relationships with Other Factions

The Gifted has a complex relationship with other factions in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|the Basin]]. While they are generally seen as a non-violent and benevolent force by many, their secretive nature and hidden rituals have also attracted suspicion and distrust.

One notable offshoot faction is [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/The Shaddowhammer\|the Shaddowhammer]], who share similar goals with the Gifted but have chosen to follow a darker path. They harness the powers of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Ilsensine\|Ilsensine]], an Eldritch deity, to achieve their aims, often clashing with members of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]]'s faithful.

Despite their differences and occasional conflicts, both factions ultimately serve [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]]'s will in their own way, making them uneasy allies at times when facing common enemies or pursuing shared objectives.

# League of Paranormal Researchers and The Gifted

The League of Paranormal Researchers (LPF) has taken a great interest in studying both Nosem and the mysterious powers of The Gifted. They suspect that there may be a connection between the two phenomena, but they have yet to uncover any concrete evidence.

> [!info] Info 
> Members of the LPF have been conducting secret experiments on people with high ambitions in an attempt to provoke Nosem energy. This research may lead them closer to understanding the nature of The Gifted's powers.

In their pursuit for answers, some members of the LPF have infiltrated The Gifted, hoping to learn more about their abilities and their connection to Naruun. However, they must tread carefully, for if their true intentions are discovered, they could be branded as enemies by both The Gifted and Naruun.
