## Beliefs

The Gifted worships [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]] as the true god of death, believing he holds dominion over life and death itself. They see him not as an evil force but as a benevolent deity who can grant them their deepest desires in exchange for their devotion.

They believe this ritual will not only bring back all those who have died in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|the Basin]] but also revert every undead creature back to its original human form. To achieve this, they need to gather enough Soul energy and construct a massive apparatus somewhere in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|the Basin]] that channels [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]]'s power.

>[!secret]- Location of the Ritual

## Structure

The Gifted is organized into several tiers, each with its own responsibilities and privileges. At the lowest level are Acolytes who serve as missionaries and healers throughout [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|the Basin]]. Above them are Preachers who lead congregations in worship and rituals dedicated to [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]].

Higher-ranking members include Elders who oversee multiple congregations within a region, guiding them in their pursuit of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]]'s blessings. The inner circle comprises high-ranking priests known as Fulfillers who act as direct intermediaries between [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]] and his followers, receiving visions and instructions from the god himself.

At the very top are [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Cult of the Gifted/Iraia\|Iraia]] and [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Cult of the Gifted/Edard Combell\|Edard Combell]].

## Relationships with Other Factions

The Gifted has a complex relationship with other factions in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|the Basin]]. While they are generally seen as a non-violent and benevolent force by many, their secretive nature and hidden rituals have also attracted suspicion and distrust.

One notable offshoot faction is [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/The Shaddowhammer\|the Shaddowhammer]], who share similar goals with the Gifted but have chosen to follow a darker path. They harness the powers of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Ilsensine\|Ilsensine]], an Eldritch deity, to achieve their aims, often clashing with members of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]]'s faithful.
