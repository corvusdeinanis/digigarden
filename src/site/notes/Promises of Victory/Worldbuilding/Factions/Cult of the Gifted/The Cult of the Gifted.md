The Cult of the Gifted is a religious organization that has spread throughout the Basin, gathering followers and growing in power. They worship Naruun, the God of Death, whom they believe can resurrect and grant wishes to those who serve him faithfully. The cult is primarily made up of people who have lost someone important in their lives, seeking solace and hope in Naruun's promises. As more join their ranks, they continue to gain influence and power throughout the Basin.

## Appearance

The Cult has multiple layers of appearance. To the public, the Acolytes of the Gifted are seen wearing bright white robes adorned with intricate purple stitching. These robes serve as a symbol of their devotion to Naruun and help them stand out among other religious groups.

In their private circles, however, a more mystical side emerges. The magic used by the Cult resembles dust swirling through the air and has an ethereal quality to it. Their rituals often involve light-induced trances that transport participants into otherworldly visions or experiences.

## Beliefs

The Cult of the Gifted worships Naruun as the true god of death, believing he holds dominion over life and death itself. They see him not as an evil force but as a benevolent deity who can grant them their deepest desires in exchange for their devotion.

Members believe that by serving Naruun faithfully and making the necessary sacrifices, they will be rewarded with eternal life or the resurrection of their lost loved ones. This powerful belief is what drives many to join the Cult, seeking solace and hope in Naruun's promises.

The Cult's ultimate goal is to complete a powerful magical ritual they call the Turnback. They believe this ritual will not only bring back all those who have died in the Basin but also revert every undead creature back to its original human form. To achieve this, they need to gather enough Soul energy and construct a massive apparatus somewhere in the Basin that channels Naruun's power.

## Activities

To spread their influence throughout the Basin, members of the Cult often travel from place to place, acting as preachers and healers. They offer aid and comfort to those suffering from grief or loss, using their empathetic nature and promises of resurrection to draw new followers into their ranks.

While they present themselves as a non-violent faction focused on healing and restoration, they are not without secrets. In order to fuel their Turnback ritual and gain favor with Naruun, members engage in sacrificial rites that involve innocent individuals or even undead creatures. These sacrifices are kept hidden from the public eye but provide the soul energy needed for their grand plan.

## Structure

The Cult of the Gifted is organized into several tiers, each with its own responsibilities and privileges. At the lowest level are Acolytes who serve as missionaries and healers throughout the Basin. Above them are Preachers who lead congregations in worship and rituals dedicated to Naruun.

Higher-ranking members include Elders who oversee multiple congregations within a region, guiding them in their pursuit of Naruun's blessings. The inner circle comprises high-ranking priests known as Fulfillers who act as direct intermediaries between Naruun and his followers, receiving visions and instructions from the god himself.

## Relationships with Other Factions

The Cult of the Gifted has a complex relationship with other factions in the Basin. While they are generally seen as a non-violent and benevolent force by many, their secretive nature and hidden rituals have also attracted suspicion and distrust.

One notable offshoot faction is the Shaddowhammer, who share similar goals with the Cult but have chosen to follow a darker path. They harness the powers of Ilsensine, an Eldritch deity, to achieve their aims, often clashing with members of Naruun's faithful.

Despite their differences and occasional conflicts, both factions ultimately serve Naruun's will in their own way, making them uneasy allies at times when facing common enemies or pursuing shared objectives.
