Malachi is the leader of the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Defilers/Defilers\|Defilers]], and a powerful sorcerer. She was exiled from [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/üè∞Lichtachte/Lichtachte\|Lichtachte]] for her experiments with necromancy, but she has since amassed a great army of undead soldiers and orcs. She is a strong leader, and she defends her people with everything that she has. Her most controversial invention was called "The Plage" which she used to create many undead people after a big attack on [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/üè∞Lichtachte/Lichtachte\|Lichtachte]] by hordes of zombies.
