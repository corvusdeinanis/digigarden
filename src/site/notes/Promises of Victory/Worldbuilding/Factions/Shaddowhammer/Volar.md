## Backstory
Volar was once Tarwin Althammer, a great paladin who served in the ongoing war wielding Shaddowbane artifact armor. He had a wife in enemy territory whom he would visit during downtime. Tragically, their daughter was murdered; soon after, his wife died from heartbreak. Blaming himself for their deaths, Volar retired as General and started studying resurrection rituals. Naruun used Volar's grief to manipulate him into becoming a pawn for his own release. The Fulfiller planted evidence of the Turnback ritual, which Volar believed would restore his family and everyone who died in the war. In reality, it would only free Naruun from imprisonment.

Volar co-founded The Gifted with the secret goal of fulfilling the Turnback ritual but later separated from them due to their insufficient progress. Harnessing the powers of another Old God, Ilsensine, he founded The Shaddowhammer to complete the ritual at any cost.
