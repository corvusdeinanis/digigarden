As the leader of the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/The Shaddowhammer\|Shaddowhammer]], Volar was once a paladin, that lost his child in the war, he thinks, he can resurrect his child if he fulfills a ritual demanding the souls of many people. What he doesn't know is that it will free the evil god [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]] and take his life in the process.

Volar is oblivious to the truth and is being deceived by [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]]. He is blinded by his grief and doesn't see the consequences of his actions. The cultists are just blindly following him, not knowing what they're doing is wrong.

# Volars Past
Volar was once a great paladin called [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/League of Arathor/Tarwin Althammer\|Tarwin Althammer]], in service of the ongoing War and holder of the [[Promises of Victory/General/Storys/Artifact of Life\|Artifact of Life]]. He had a Wife in the Enemies territory but this didn't hold him back to come visit them in his downtime. Sadly, his daughter was murdered.
He was devastated by this and his wife soon died of a broken heart. Volar blamed himself for not being there and swore to never let anything like this happen again.
He retired as General and started studying resurrections and dwelled deep into forbidden rituals. [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]] used this strong desire to make him his pawn. [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/The Fulfiller\|The Fulfiller]] planted evidence of a mighty resurrection ritual called the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Turnback\|Turnback]] that would not only resurrect his lost wife and daughter, but all people that died in the war. In Reality it would only break the Prison of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]].
This lead to the founding of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Cult of the Gifted/The Cult of the Gifted\|The Cult of the Gifted]], that made it their secret Goal to fulfill the Ritual.
Some years after the founding, Volar separated from the Cult because in his eyes, they didn't make enough progress.
Harnessing the Powers of another Old God called [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Ilsensine\|Ilsensine]] he founded [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/The Shaddowhammer\|The Shaddowhammer]] with the Goal of to fulfill the ritual at all coast.
