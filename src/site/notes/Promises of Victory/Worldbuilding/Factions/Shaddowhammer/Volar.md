He had a Wife in the Enemies territory but this didn't hold him back to come visit them in his downtime. Sadly, his daughter was murdered.
He was devastated by this and his wife soon died of a broken heart. Volar blamed himself for not being there and swore to never let anything like this happen again.
He retired as General and started studying resurrections and dwelled deep into forbidden rituals. [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]] used this strong desire to make him his pawn. [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/The Fulfiller\|The Fulfiller]] planted evidence of a mighty resurrection ritual called the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Turnback\|Turnback]] that would not only resurrect his lost wife and daughter, but all people that died in the war. In Reality it would only break the Prison of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]].
This lead to the founding of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Cult of the Gifted/The Gifted\|The Gifted]], that made it their secret Goal to fulfill the Ritual.

# Fighting Volar
Volar is the main Antagonist of the Adventure and will likely be encountered towards the end of the campaign. He is a powerful combatant, having mastered both martial prowess and forbidden magic. His primary goal is to complete the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Turnback\|Turnback]] ritual to resurrect his lost family, but he is also fiercely protective of his followers within [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/The Shaddowhammer\|The Shaddowhammer]].

> [!warning] Warning
> Remember that Volar's motivation is driven by grief and a misguided desire to undo past tragedies. He is not inherently evil, but rather blinded by his emotions and manipulated by malevolent forces.

When facing Volar in battle, players should expect to encounter a skilled warrior who employs both melee attacks with his enchanted weapon and divine spells granted by his connection to [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]]. He may also be accompanied by other members of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/The Shaddowhammer\|The Shaddowhammer]], such as powerful cultists or summoned creatures.

In order to defeat Volar, the party must not only overcome his martial prowess but also break the hold that [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]] has over him. This can be achieved through various means â€“ perhaps uncovering evidence that reveals the true nature of the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Turnback\|Turnback]] ritual or presenting him with proof that his actions are only serving to further Naruun's evil goals.

If the party can convince Volar of the error of his ways, he may renounce his allegiance to Naruun and join forces with them in their efforts to stop the dark god from being released upon the world. In this scenario, Volar could provide valuable information about Naruun's prison and how it might be resealed once more.

> [!tip] GM Tip
> Consider allowing players who have successfully convinced Volar to change sides access to unique abilities or spells granted by their newfound alliance with him. This could provide an interesting narrative twist as well as mechanical rewards for their efforts.
