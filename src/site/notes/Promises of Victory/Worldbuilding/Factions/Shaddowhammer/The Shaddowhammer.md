The Shaddowhammer is a extreme offspring of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Cult of the Gifted/The Cult of the Gifted\|The Cult of the Gifted]]. They share the same goal as the Cult, but decided to go a extremer and darker path by using the powers of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Ilsensine\|Ilsensine]], an Eldrich deity. 
In Secret the Shaddowhammer plans on taking over [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]] to collect Soul Energy from the slaughtered people. This is only a temporary loss, because once they have enough energy to fuel the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Turnback\|Turnback]], they plan to bring back every lost soul in the Basin.
Parts of the Soul Energy are used as an offering to [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Ilsensine\|Ilsensine]] who in response grants them additional Powers and Abilities. Since the ongoing war in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]] has many casualties, the Shaddowhammer directly profits in the ongoing war.


## Structure of the Cult

The Cult is divided into 3 parts. The first part is the Inner Circle, which consists of the leaders of the cult. The second part is the Outer Circle, which consists of the regular cultists. The third part is the Army, which consists of the people that the cult has brainwashed into serving them. The cult has been gaining in power as more and more people join. They have been performing small sacrifices to try and please their god.
The cult has a strict hierarchy. The leader of the cult is [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Volar\|Volar]]. Beneath him are the leaders of the Inner Circle. Beneath them are the leaders of the Outer Circle. Beneath them are the regular cultists. And beneath them are the people that have been brainwashed into serving the cult.
The cult is very secretive and only allows people that they trust into their inner circle. They are willing to do anything to achieve their goals and will stop at nothing to get what they want.

### Shaddowspire

The cult is based in the city of Shadowspire, which is located in the middle of the Endless Caves. Right ontop of the prison of their God. Since every tentacle was emerging from the physical core of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]], every cave leads to the Shadowspire.
