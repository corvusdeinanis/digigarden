The Turnback is the Ritual that the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Cult of the Gifted/The Cult of the Gifted\|The Cult of the Gifted]] wants to complete to bring back everyone that died in the war in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]].
In reality it will break [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]]s Prison and set him free.

The Turnback was first given to [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Volar\|Volar]] by [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/The Fulfiller\|The Fulfiller]].
