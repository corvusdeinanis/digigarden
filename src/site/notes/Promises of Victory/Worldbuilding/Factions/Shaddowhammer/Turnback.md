In reality it will break [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]]s Prison and set him free.

The Turnback was first given to [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Volar\|Volar]] by [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Fulfiller/The Fulfiller\|The Fulfiller]].
