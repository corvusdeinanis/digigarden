## Research about the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Nosem/Nosem\|Nosem]]

One Branch of the LPF is the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Nosem/Nosem\|Nosem]] Research Department, which is devoted to understanding the nature and purpose of the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Nosem/Nosem\|Nosem]].
The [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Nosem/Nosem\|Nosem]] Research Department has been studying the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Nosem/Nosem\|Nosem]] for many years, and they have a lot of knowledge about them. They know that the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Nosem/Nosem\|Nosem]] are benevolent beings who help the [[Promises of Victory/Adventuring/Arcs/Souls of the Dead\|Souls of the Dead]] to release their pent-up anxiety and move on to the afterlife.
They have trouble to get in Contact with the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Nosem/Nosem\|Nosem]], as they are very secretive, but they have managed to observe them at deathbeads on single ocasions.
Recently [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/The Fulfiller\|The Fulfiller]] gave some researchers some machinery to see into what happens at a near death scenario.
They observed that the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Nosem/Nosem\|Nosem]] are guiding the [[Promises of Victory/Adventuring/Arcs/Souls of the Dead\|Souls of the Dead]] with unfulfilled ambitions through their last whishes.

### Dark Secrets

On the surface level, the research is very novel, but at the deeper levels of the LPF some academics take more drastic measures to get results.
The commitment goes as far as to intentionally poison people, who have high ambitions, to provoke the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Nosem/Nosem\|Nosem]] to show up.  
Those experiments are kept under lock and key far away from other researchers and the public, as the method is highly unethical.
