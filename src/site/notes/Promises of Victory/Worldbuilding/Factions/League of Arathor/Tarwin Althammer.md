Tarwin Althammer was a respected and honorable human Paladin, renowned for his stalwart dedication to justice and upholding the law. His skill in combat was matched only by his strong sense of morality, and he was known for his unwavering loyalty to the righteous cause.

Tarwin hailed from the city of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/🏰Gandmühl/Gandmühl\|Gandmühl]], where he lived with his beloved wife Marit, an elven musician, and their daughter Reyala - a prodigy whose life was cut too short by a tragic and mysterious murder. Tarwin's great pain at this loss was only compounded by being unjustly accused of the murder himself, an experience that drove him to eventually leave [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/🏰Gandmühl/Gandmühl\|Gandmühl]] in search of solace elsewhere.

On this journey Tarwin encountered incredible danger and hardship, yet also discovered a renewed sense of purpose as he worked to understand what had happened to his family in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/🏰Gandmühl/Gandmühl\|Gandmühl]]. His travels eventually brought him to [[Promises of Victory/Adventuring/Player Characters/Ransden\|Ransden]], where he used the knowledge gained from his experiences to create documents that would help others find justice in similar situations.
