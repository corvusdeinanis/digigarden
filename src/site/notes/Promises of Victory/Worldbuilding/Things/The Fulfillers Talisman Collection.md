The talismans used by the Fulfiller are an essential component of her ability to manipulate others and feed on their negative emotions. These trinkets serve as a physical link to her victims, allowing her to influence their actions and emotions more effectively.

## Appearance

The talismans used by the Fulfiller come in various shapes and forms, ranging from simple charms and amulets to more intricate pieces of jewelry or small personal items. Each talisman is unique in design, often bearing symbols or markings that relate to the individual from whom it was taken. They are usually made from materials that can absorb and store bad emotions, such as obsidian or hematite.

## Function

When a person makes a deal with the Fulfiller, she requires them to give her an object of significance as part of the bargain. This object then becomes their talisman, linking them to the Fulfiller and allowing her to manipulate their emotions and fate.

Once a talisman is in her possession, the Fulfiller can use it to influence the thoughts and feelings of its owner. This allows her to guide them towards actions that will ultimately lead to their downfall, all while feeding on their growing despair.

Additionally, by storing these talismans in her tent among countless other trinkets, the Fulfiller creates an ever-growing pool of negative energy that she can draw upon when needed. This accumulated power may be used for various purposes such as enhancing her own abilities or fueling dark rituals aimed at releasing [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]] from his imprisonment.

## Breakage

If a talisman is destroyed or removed from the Fulfiller's possession, its owner may experience some relief from her influence. However, this does not mean they are entirely severed from her grasp; traces of connection may still linger between them. Depending on how deeply they were affected by the Fulfiller's manipulation, it may take time and effort to fully recover from her influence.

Furthermore, breaking the connection with the Fulfiller might cause unpredictable consequences for the individual. The sudden release of negative energy stored within the talisman may manifest in various ways, such as a brief surge of heightened emotions or even physical repercussions.

## Roleplaying Opportunities

The talismans provide a way for player characters to interact with the Fulfiller's schemes more directly. Discovering their existence and understanding their function could lead to new quests or challenges, as the heroes try to free themselves or others from her grasp.
