## The Turnback Ritual
For the last 20 Years [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Cult of the Gifted/The Gifted\|The Gifted]] are building an Arcane Machine out of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Things/Stoalium\|Stoalium]] that they think will lead to the resurrection of all fallen People in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]]. The [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/The Triad/The Triad\|The Triad]] has been hiding the many shipments of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Things/Stoalium\|Stoalium]] towards the Ritual Site. 
When all Artifacts are brought to their respective Forges and the Seals are broken.  The [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Turnback\|Turnback]] ritual will begin, leading to the release of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]], the old god of false promises. [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Cult of the Gifted/The Gifted\|The Gifted]] Ones, believing they will revive every lost soul in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]], will unknowingly bring about [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]]'s return and potential domination over the world.
As the ritual commences, a colossal [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Things/Stoalium\|Stoalium]] contraption built by the Cult beneath the city of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/üè∞Edschmied/Edschmied\|Edschmied]] will start to channel the gathered soul' energy into each of the three forges. 
It takes one week for the Prison of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]] to break.   
The party must race against time to not only prevent [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Naruun\|Naruun]]'s escape but also find a way to destroy or contain him for good.
