![Pasted image 20230330011335.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020230330011335.png)
Promises of Victory is a Campain set in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]], a Region currently in war, lead by the **[[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/League of Arathor/League of Arathor\|League of Arathor]]** and the **[[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Defilers/Defilers\|Defilers]]**.

In the Background [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/The Shaddowhammer\|The Shaddowhammer]] clan is preparing a ritual that will return the old God [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]], who is sealed deep underground in the middle of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]]. The Cult sees the old God as the true god of death and the ritual will revive every lost soul in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]].

To do that, [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/The Shaddowhammer\|The Shaddowhammer]] are in the process of collecting 3 Artifacts that were used to seal the old god.

- The **Heart of the forrest**, the [[Promises of Victory/General/Storys/Artifact of Life\|Artifact of Life]] which they try to get by Invading city of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/Todo/Sturmklau\|Sturmklau]] 
- The **Tear of the Archdevil**, the [[Promises of Victory/General/Storys/Artifact of Chaos\|Artifact of Chaos]] which the players are bringing into [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]] to be delivered to [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/Dr Phalando\|Dr Phalando]] 
- **Sundawn**, the [[Promises of Victory/General/Storys/Artifact of Light\|Artifact of Light]] which they already have since their Leader [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Volar\|Volar]] is a Fallen Paladin of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/üè∞Lichtachte/Lichtachte\|Lichtachte]] 

They need to bring the Artifacts to 3 different ancient arcane machineries called [[Promises of Victory/General/Storys/Titan Forges\|Titan Forges]] and fuel the Jail with a vast amount of soul energy.

To activate the Ritual the call the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/Turnback\|Turnback]] they need a gigantic amount of  [[Promises of Victory/General/Storys/Souls of the Dead\|Souls of the Dead]] that they have been gathering on the Battlefields and funneling into the Central City of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/üè∞Edschmied/Edschmied\|Edschmied]] 

The party has to find the artifacts to maybe alter the ritual and kill [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]] for good, while not also falling to the false promisses of the old god. This is a Major Plot twist. The Party starts by searching for the Artifacts and thinks bringing them to the Forges harms the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Shaddowhammer/The Shaddowhammer\|Shaddowhammer]].

This leads to the endless war going back and fourth. With one party pusshing right to the enemys gate, but then loosing by a sudden turn of events.

The party can learn, that the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Stoalium\|Stoalium]] is the reason for this unending loop, that they can use to end the conflict once and for all.

## Naruuns Real Identity

By learning his true identity, they can devise a plan to expose him and his manipulations to the people of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]], weakening his power and influence over them.

Through their investigation, the party can discover that [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Naruun\|Naruun]] has been feeding on the despair and unfulfilled desires of the people in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]], using their suffering to increase his power. The continuous war, fueled by the properties of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Stoalium\|Stoalium]], has provided Naruun with an endless supply of misery.

Armed with this knowledge, the party can seek allies among both the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/League of Arathor/League of Arathor\|League of Arathor]] and the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Defilers/Defilers\|Defilers]], uniting them against a common enemy.
