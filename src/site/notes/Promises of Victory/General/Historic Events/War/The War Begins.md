The War began in the year 3024 when the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Defilers/Defilers\|Defilers]] attacked multiple cities in the west of [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]]. The [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/League of Arathor/League of Arathor\|League of Arathor]] was quick to respond, and they pushed the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Defilers/Defilers\|Defilers]] back. The war continued for four years, with neither side gaining an advantage.
