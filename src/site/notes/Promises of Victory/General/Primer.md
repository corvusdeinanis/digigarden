As you find yourself standing atop a hill, surveying the ongoing battle, you become aware of the ever-present whispers in the shadows. An evil force seems to be lurking just out of sight, manipulating events and twisting the hearts of those involved. This is not just any war - this is a war that has raged for five long years in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]], and it is far from over.

In this embattled land, loss and sorrow are all too familiar. Children grow up without parents, and sages are hardened by years of witnessing the horrors of war. Both the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/League of Arathor/League of Arathor\|League of Arathor]] and their enemies, the Defilers, covet [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]]'s resources for their own purposes. Peace seems like a distant dream.

Key locations in this struggle include Torar, a mining town where goblins from Venture and Co. extract precious [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Naruun/Stoalium\|Stoalium]], and Edschmied, where the renowned Thorium Brotherhood forges powerful equipment using this rare resource. Control over these locations shifts constantly as both sides vie for power. However, an unspoken understanding keeps dwarves and goblins relatively safe â€“ both sides recognize their need for goblin technology and ancient dwarven smithing skills.

Recently, hope seemed to be on the horizon when forces from the [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/League of Arathor/League of Arathor\|League of Arathor]] nearly captured Desecrated Stronghold, the last bastion of opposition in [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]]. However, their momentum faltered at a critical moment, allowing their enemies to launch a fierce counterattack that drove them back to square one.

As you embark on your adventure within this war-torn realm, remember: things are not always as they seem. Dark forces work behind the scenes, and only through courage, wit, and determination can you hope to uncover their true intentions and bring lasting peace to [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]].
