[[1. General/Things/The Plague\|The Plague]] was a necrotic virus that was spread by the necromancer [[2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Defilers/General Malachi\|Malachi]]. It caused the recently deceased to rise from the dead as zombies with their souls still affixed to them. [[1. General/Things/The Plague\|The Plague]] caused a great divide in [[2. Worldbuilding/2.

Factions/League of Arathor/League of Arathor\|League of Arathor]] to this day sees the undead as the same monsters that killed many of their kin.
