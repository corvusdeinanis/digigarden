#ADHD 
Understanding that your productivity system will eventually fail is crucial for individuals with ADHD. Instead of feeling discouraged, embrace the pivot and be prepared to adapt to a new system when needed. This way, you can avoid self-blame and frustration.

To embrace the pivot:

- Accept that no system is perfect, and it's okay for it to fail at some point.
- Be open to change and trying new strategies when your current system stops working.
- Don't pour all your energy into one system, knowing that you may need to switch later.
- Avoid feeling guilty or ashamed when a system fails â€“ it worked for a time, and now it's time to move on.

By embracing the pivot, you acknowledge that productivity is an ongoing journey with ups and downs. This mindset allows you to stay flexible, adaptive, and motivated as you continue working towards better productivity with your ADHD brain.
