The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique involves breaking work into short, focused intervals (usually 25 minutes) called "Pomodoros," followed by a brief break (typically 5 minutes). This cycle is repeated until the task is completed.

For individuals with ADHD, using Pomodoro timers can be incredibly helpful for maintaining focus and preventing burnout. However, it's essential to adjust the intervals to fit your personal needs and preferences. For example, you might find that working for 15 minutes followed by a 10-minute break works best for you, or even extending the work interval when you're feeling particularly focused.

To use Pomodoro timers effectively:

1. Choose a task you'd like to complete.
2. Set a timer for your preferred work interval (e.g., 25 minutes).
3. Work on the task until the timer goes off.
4. Take a short break (e.g., 5 minutes) to rest and recharge.
5. Repeat this process until the task is complete or you feel ready to move on to another task.

Using Pomodoro timers can help maintain motivation and focus while also giving your brain regular breaks to prevent overwhelm and burnout. Additionally, tracking how many Pomodoros it takes to complete a task can provide valuable insight into your productivity levels and help with future planning.
