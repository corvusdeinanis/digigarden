#ADHD 
Looking for some side quests to help you stay motivated and make progress on your main project? Here's a cool way to get started:

- [ ] Break down your main project into smaller, manageable tasks. This makes it easier to find awesome side quests!

- [ ] Pick side quests that are super engaging and follow the four C's of motivation (captivate, create, compete, and complete). They should be interesting and challenging enough to keep your ADHD brain hooked.

- [ ] Set a time limit for your side quests. Use a timer or due date to prevent getting lost in them, so you can stay focused on your main goal.

- [ ] Keep an eye on how much time you're spending on side quests compared to your main project. If you see that they're taking up too much time or energy, adjust accordingly to maintain balance.

- [ ] Celebrate those small wins from completing side quests! They can boost your motivation and help you continue working on the main project. Just remember not to let them overshadow the larger goal.

By using side quests effectively, you'll be able to build momentum and stay motivated while working towards your primary goals. Enjoy the journey!
