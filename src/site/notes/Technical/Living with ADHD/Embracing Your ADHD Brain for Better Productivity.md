It's no secret that people with ADHD struggle with productivity. Traditional productivity systems are designed for neurotypical brains, often leaving those with ADHD feeling overwhelmed, unmotivated, and labeled as lazy or disorganized. However, by understanding the unique needs of an ADHD brain and utilizing tailored strategies, it is possible to overcome these challenges and unlock a new level of productivity.

## Understanding the ADHD Brain

ADHD brains differ from neurotypical ones in three main ways:

1. **Motivation**: Traditional productivity systems rely on importance, rewards, and consequences to motivate individuals. However, ADHD brains are motivated by interest and the "four C's" - captivate, create, compete, and complete.
2. **Overwhelm**: When faced with too much work or responsibility, an ADHD brain can shut down completely. This makes it impossible to "push through" and get tasks done.
3. **Distractions**: Neurotypical productivity advice often involves breaking tasks into smaller steps or focusing on the most important task first. Unfortunately, this can lead to increased distractions for those with ADHD.

To increase productivity as an individual with ADHD, it is essential to acknowledge these differences and adapt your approach accordingly.
