#ADHD 
One of the most effective ways to improve productivity for individuals with ADHD is to change your environment. This can help keep your brain engaged and interested, making it easier to focus on tasks at hand. Some ideas for changing your environment include:

- [ ] *New location, new focus*: Don't just work at home – switch it up with a coffee shop or library. New places can help your brain feel more motivated!

- [ ] *Rearrange = Refresh*: Move furniture or work in a different room. It'll make your workspace feel exciting again.

- [ ] *Background noise is key*: Music or ambient sounds can help you concentrate. Try different noises to find the perfect fit.

- [ ] *Go natural*: Add plants or use wood/stone in your decor – nature helps keep you calm and focused.

- [ ] *Lighting matters*: Play with different lights (natural light, task lighting) and brightness to find what works best for you.

- [ ] *Declutter = Less distraction*: Clear your desk of unnecessary stuff – fewer distractions mean better focus!

Remember: Keeping your environment fresh can really help with focus when you have ADHD!
