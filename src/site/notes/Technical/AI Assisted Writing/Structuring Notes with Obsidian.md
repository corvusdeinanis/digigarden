## Structuring Notes with Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a versatile note-taking app that enables users to create and manage their knowledge base effectively. It offers a unique graph view feature that allows you to visualize connections between your notes easily. This feature makes it easy to navigate through your notes, find related content, and uncover hidden patterns in your thinking.

Obsidian supports Markdown language, which enables you to format your text quickly without relying on complex formatting tools. Moreover, the app offers several plugins that can further enhance its functionality by adding features like task management or custom themes.
