# Finding a Note Structure for Adventure Modules

When creating an adventure module, it is essential to have a well-structured note system to convey the most important information to the reader effectively. The purpose of this article is to provide you with a generic structure for your notes, focusing on non-player characters (NPCs) as an example.

## Why Does the Reader Read the Article?

The reader might be looking for:

- Curiosity: Engage the reader with interesting content.
- Quick lookup: Provide fast information access.
- Inspiration: Offer ideas on how to use the character in their campaign.
- Context: Explain who the character is and their role in the story.
- Preparation for a session: Give details on roleplaying and character traits.

## Meta Structure of Articles

Based on these reader needs, my  suggestion is dividing your note structure into three main sections:

### Introduction

- Engaging introduction to the subject, sparking curiosity.
- Sidebar with quick reference information for easy lookup.
- Role in the campaign - provide a meta explanation of the subjects's  function in the story.

### Lore Section

- History or backstory of the character.
- Relationships with other characters or factions.
- Other interesting aspects about the subject (e.g., unique abilities, secrets).

### Roleplaying Section

- Physical appearance and mannerisms.
- Guide for roleplaying as, in, or with the subject (e.g., speech patterns, motivations).
  - For NPCs:
    - Ideals
    - Bonds
    - Flaws
    - Quirks (something memorable that sets them apart)

## Example: NPCs Note Structure

Using this structure, let's create an example template for notes about NPCs:

```markdown

## Introduction
*Prompt: Write a engaging introduction about the NPC.*

Role in Campaign: 
*Prompt: describe how the NPC fits in the campain and how it propells the story.*

> [!TIP] Quick Refference
> ![Placeholder.png| 300](/img/user/resources/Pictures/Placeholder.png) 
> **Insert Name** _Race Class_ 
>  One sentence description
>- **Motivation**: in, single, keywords
>- **Ideals**: in, single, keywords
>- **Bonds**: in, single, keywords
>- **Flaws**: in, single, keywords
> ----
>- **Roleplaying Tips**: Things to be reminded while roleplaying
>-  **Quirk**: something memorable

## Lore
### Backstory
*Prompt: Write a text about the background information.*

### Relations
*Prompt: Describe The NPC's relationships with other characters or factions in a list.*

### Prompt: Other Interesting Aspects (replace with fitting Headings )
*Prompt: Maybe the NPC has other aspects that are important to highlight. (at least add one)*

## Roleplaying
### Appearance
*Prompt: Describe The NPC's physical appearance and mannerisms.*

### Roleplaying Guide
*Prompt:Offer a guide to the most important aspects about roleplaying the NPC.*

#### Ideals
*Prompt: Write one or two paragraphs about the Ideals of the NPC and how to show them to the PCs*

#### Bonds
*Prompt: Write one or two paragraphs about the Bonds of the NPC and how to show them to the PCs*

#### Flaws
*Prompt: Write one or two paragraphs about the Flaws of the NPC and how to show them to the PCs*

#### Quirks
*Mention a memorable trait that sets them apart from others.*

## Trivia
*Prompt: Put a List of things here that didn't fit into the above sections and might not be as important*  
```

With this structure in place, you'll be able to create informative and engaging notes for your adventure module while ensuring that readers can quickly find the information they need.

A Example Implementation of this structure is: [[Promises of Victory/Worldbuilding/Factions/Unaffiliated/The Fulfiller\|The Fulfiller]]


## Improvements
This is just a collection of my thoughts. This is a list of Improvements I could make:
- [ ] Offering alternative formats or layouts for different types of NPCs (e.g., major vs. minor characters) to cater to varying levels of detail and complexity.
- [ ] Including optional sections or subsections that address unique aspects of certain NPCs, such as special abilities, equipment, or unique story arcs.
- [x] Encouraging writers to provide examples or anecdotes from their own campaigns to help readers imagine how the NPC might be used in practice.

Overall, continuously refining and iterating on the note structure based on feedback from readers and personal experience will lead to more effective and engaging adventure modules.
