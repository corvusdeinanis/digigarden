When I write about a Characters the Following I want to format it in a way to get the most important information for the reader in front.
Why does the Reader read the article?
-> Curiosity (engage reader)
-> Quick lookup (fast information)
-> Inspiration (What could i do with this Character)
-> Context (Who is this Character?)
-> Preperation for Session (Details)
	-> How do I Roleplay?
	-> What are the Details about this Character?

This leads to a meta structure of the Articles:
*Introduction*
- Engaging Introduction to subject -> Curiosity
- Sidebar with Quick Refference for Quick Lookup
- Role in the Campain -> Meta Explenation about the Char
*Lore Section*
- History or Backstory
- Relations
- Other things Interesting about the Subject 
*Roleplaying Section*
- Appearance
- Guide for Roleplaying as/in/with the Subject
- For Characters:
	- Ideals
	- Bonds
	- Flaws
	- Quirks -> something memorable

## NPCs
First things that come to mind are NPCs.
This is the template I use: 

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">

# Finding a Note Structure for Adventure Modules

When creating an adventure module, it is essential to have a well-structured note system to convey the most important information to the reader effectively. The purpose of this article is to provide you with a generic structure for your notes, focusing on non-player characters (NPCs) as an example.

## Why Does the Reader Read the Article?

The reader might be looking for:

- Curiosity: Engage the reader with interesting content.
- Quick lookup: Provide fast information access.
- Inspiration: Offer ideas on how to use the character in their campaign.
- Context: Explain who the character is and their role in the story.
- Preparation for a session: Give details on roleplaying and character traits.

## Meta Structure of Articles

Based on these reader needs, we suggest dividing your note structure into three main sections:

### Introduction

- Engaging introduction to the subject, sparking curiosity.
- Sidebar with quick reference information for easy lookup.
- Role in the campaign - provide a meta explanation of the subjects's  function in the story.

### Lore Section

- History or backstory of the character.
- Relationships with other characters or factions.
- Other interesting aspects about the subject (e.g., unique abilities, secrets).

### Roleplaying Section

- Physical appearance and mannerisms.
- Guide for roleplaying as, in, or with the subject (e.g., speech patterns, motivations).
  - For NPCs:
    - Ideals
    - Bonds
    - Flaws
    - Quirks (something memorable that sets them apart)

## Example: NPCs Note Structure
