## Organizing Knowledge with Zettelkasten

The [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) method is a proven note-taking system that helps you organize your thoughts and ideas in a systematic way. It involves creating atomic notes - small pieces of information - which are then linked together by their relationships.

By employing the Zettelkasten method within Obsidian, you can create a powerful network of interconnected ideas. This makes it easier to build upon these ideas over time while avoiding information overload or unnecessary duplication. The combination of Obsidian's linking features and the Zettelkasten method creates an ideal environment for managing large knowledge bases and fostering creativity.
