#ADHD 
Micro commitments are small, manageable tasks that you can commit to completing in order to build momentum and eventually tackle larger tasks. For individuals with ADHD, getting started on a task can be incredibly challenging due to feelings of overwhelm or lack of motivation. By breaking down larger tasks into smaller micro commitments, you can make it easier to take that first step and begin making progress on your goals.

- [ ] **Choose a big task or goal**: Pick something you've had trouble starting or moving forward with.
- [ ] **Make it smaller**: Split the big task into tinier, doable parts that won't take too long to finish.
- [ ] **Pick one tiny task**: Find one small task from the list that feels easy enough to do without getting overwhelmed.
- [ ] **Get it done and celebrate**: Finish the chosen task and give yourself a pat on the back for doing it! This will help you feel motivated to keep going.
- [ ] **Keep going, one step at a time**: Keep breaking down tasks into micro commitments and tackle them one by one until you've reached your goal.

Remember, using micro commitments can help you face overwhelm and procrastination, making it easier for you to focus and achieve your goals!
