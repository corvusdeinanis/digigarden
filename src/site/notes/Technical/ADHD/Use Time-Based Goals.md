#ADHD 
Setting time-based goals is an effective strategy for individuals with ADHD to improve productivity. Instead of focusing on specific outcomes or the completion of a task, the focus is shifted to how long you will work on it. This approach offers several benefits:

1. **Reduces overwhelm**: Focusing on a specific amount of time spent working on a task can make it feel more manageable and less daunting.

2. **Improves time estimation skills**: ADHD individuals often struggle with accurately estimating how long tasks will take. By setting time-based goals, you can better understand the relationship between time and task completion.

3. **Encourages progress**: Even if you don't complete a task within your set timeframe, spending dedicated time working on it can still lead to progress and momentum.

4. **Allows for flexibility**: Time-based goals allow for adjustments based on energy levels, distractions, and other factors that may impact productivity.

To implement time-based goals in your workflow, try the following steps:

1. Choose a task you want to work on.
2. Determine how long you will spend working on this task (e.g., 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.)
3. Set a timer for your chosen timeframe.
4. Begin working on the task and focus solely on it during this period.
5. When the timer ends, evaluate your progress and decide if additional time is needed or if you can move onto another task.

Remember that these timeframes are not set in stone and should be adjusted based on personal preferences and needs. By focusing on dedicating specific amounts of time to tasks, individuals with ADHD can improve their productivity while minimizing overwhelm and distractions.
