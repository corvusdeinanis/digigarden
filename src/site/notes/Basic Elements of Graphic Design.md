# Basic Elements of Graphic Design

Basic elements include **line**, **shape**, **form**, **texture**, and **balance**. 
## Line
- A line is a shape that connects two or more points. 
- Lines appear frequently in design; for example, in drawings and illustrations. They're also common in graphic elements, like textures, patterns, and backgrounds.
- **organization**, **emphasis**, or just **decoration**. In the example below, lines have been used to create a flow chart that guides the reader's eye from one element to the next.
- weight, color, texture, and style


## Shape

A shape is any two-dimensional area with a recognizable boundary. 

Shapes fall into two distinct categories: 
1. geometric
2. organic (where the shapes are more free form)

- can help you **organize** or **separate content**, 
  create simple illustrations, or just add interest to your work. 

## Form

When a shape becomes 3D, we call it a form

However, forms don't have to be three-dimensional shapes. **They can also be implied through illustration**, using techniques like light, shadow, and perspective to create the illusion of depth.

In two-dimensional design, form makes realism possible.

- *can bring a touch of realism to your work*

## Texture

Texture is the physical quality of a surface. 
can be **implied** through illustration
- texture adds depth and tactility to otherwise flat images

## Balance

Balance is the equal distribution of visual weight (more specifically, how much any one element attracts the viewer's eye). 

Balance can be affected by many things, including color, size, number, and negative space.

## Symmetry
**Symmetrical designs** are the same or similar on both sides of an axis. They feel balanced because each side is effectively the same (if not identical).

**Asymmetrical designs** are different, but the weight is still evenly distributed. The composition is balanced because it calls attention to the right things (in this example, the person's name and company logo).

## The rule of thirds

This imagines your work area divided into a 3x3 grid. 
The focal point of the image is placed on or near one of the grid lines, creating visual balance with the rest of the space.

We find this type of composition appealing because, according to studies, the human eye naturally follows this path when scanning a design.

## Secondary
By mixing combinations of red, yellow, and blue

## Complementary 
colours opposite

## Adjacent


# Hue, Value, and Intensity

All colours have - Hue, Intensity, and Value
Munsell System

## Hue 
Hue = name of colour
Warm or cold
Warmth of a colour is a property of hue
	- We can divide the colour wheel into two halves - 
	  with orange in the center of one one side  and blue at the center of the other   Colours near orange are warm, colours near blue are cool
	  Why? Psychological association
	  - Colours halfway between are fairly neutral
	  - To add warmth, we usually add yellow
	  - To add coldness, we usually add blue
	  - there can be a "cool green" and a "warm green"
	  - useful for colour schemes for harmony

## Value 
Most important dimension
Lightness or darkness 
**Shade** - add black
**Tint** - add white

## Intensity
aka saturation aka purity aka strength
To lower intensity, add grey

# Some rules 

## 1. Every colour affects the other colour 
and how we perceive it. 
Depending on the colour of other elements, the background, etc. something might appear too dark or too small

## 2. Adding depth 
Warmer colours seem to appear closer 
Cooler colours appear farther
Farther elements - cooler and less intense

## 3. Colour under different light conditions
direction of light, direct/indirect light, shadows, the surface underneath/reflected light, everything plays a role

## 4. Different lights create different colors
Sunlight = warm
Artificial light = cool 

setting, effect 

shadows - usually cool

## 5. Emotional Effect of Colour

## 6. Colours create different moods
Bright, warm colours - happy and light
low dark colours - gloomy

value and intensity = low? gloomy mood, serious atmosphere

## 7. Colour proportion !!!
Don't use too many colours, too intensely 
Stick to fewer hues 
too many intense colours = compete for attention, appear in disarray, sore to look at

## 8. Set Palette

# Colour Schemes
-   **Monochromatic** – Take one hue and create other elements from different shades and tints of it.
   
-   **Analogous** – Use three colors located beside one another on the color wheel (e.g., orange, yellow-orange and yellow to show sunlight). A variant is to mix white with these to form a “high-key” analogous color scheme (e.g., flames).    

-   **Complementary** – Use “opposite color” pairs—e.g., blue/yellow—to maximize contrast.

-   **Split-Complementary** (or **Compound Harmony**) – Add colors from either side of your complementary color pair to soften contrast.

-   **Triadic** – Take **three** colors which are **equally distant on the color wheel** (i.e., 120° apart: e.g., red/blue/yellow). These colors may not be vibrant, but the _scheme_ can be as it maintains harmony and high contrast. It’s easier to make visually appealing designs with this than with a complementary scheme.
   
-   **Tetradic** – Take **four colors that are two sets of complementary pairs** (e.g., orange/yellow/blue/violet) and choose one dominant color. This allows rich, interesting designs. However, watch the _balance_ between warm and cool colors.
    
-   **Square** – A variant of tetradic; you find four colors evenly spaced on the color wheel (i.e., 90° apart). Unlike tetradic, square schemes can work well if you use all four colors evenly.

# RGB vs RYB vs CMYK

RGB - **Additive** colour scheme. Used for screens. EMITS light, so more you add colours, gets brighter. Add all colours, you get white

CMYK - **Subtractive** color palette. Print. Absorbs light. More colour you add, the darker it gets. Add all colours, you get black
