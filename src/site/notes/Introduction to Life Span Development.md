# Life Span Development

development from **conception** to **death**
lifelong
progressive
orderly

**what is development?**
Development is the **pattern** of **progressive**, **orderly**
and **predictable** changes that begin at conception
and continue throughout life.

# 3 dimensions 
- cognitive
- biological
- socio-emotional

intersection of and interaction between all of these dimensions 

# Lifespan Perspective / Assumptions / Characteristics / - on Development

Development is : 
-Lifelong
	takes place from conception till death
-Multidimensional
	cognitive, physical, socio-emotional
-highly plastic
-contextual
	historical, economic, social, and cultural factors
-inter-disciplinary
-depends on historical conditions
-depends on how individual responds and acts to context

# Periods of development
1) Prenatal [[Phases of Prenatal Development\|Phases of Prenatal Development]]
2) Infancy [[Infancy, childhood, adolescence\|Infancy, childhood, adolescence]]
3) Early Childhood 
4) Middle and Late Childhood 
5) Adolescence
6) Early Adulthood [[Emerging Adulthood\|Emerging Adulthood]]
7) Middle Adulthood [[Middle Adulthood\|Middle Adulthood]]
8) Late Adulthood [[Late Adulthood\|Late Adulthood]]

# Perspectives / Key issues in Lifespan Development

## [[Nature vs Nurture\|Nature vs Nurture]]
nature - basic growth tendencies are genetically programmed into humans - it is biological 
nurture - effect of the environment; social environment and biological environment 

## Continuity vs Discontinuity
gradual, continuous process vs discrete groups or stages 
gradual or abrupt?

## Activity vs Passivity
(involvement in their own development)

## Specificity vs Generality
(is it universal or is it dependent on culture, country, community)

# Types of developmental research designs 

## Cross-sectional design 
A cross-sectional study compares the behaviors of **different age groups** at a **single time point**.

most common in developmental research 

less time-consuming and less expensive than the other methods 

## Longitudinal design
examine the **same** individuals over a period of time; **regular intervals**

Longitudinal research takes time. Sometimes people quit before it ends. This is called **attrition**. Researchers should start with larger samples as people will leave. But some groups may leave more than others. For example, people who are sick, poor, or less educated may quit more. This can make the results less accurate because the people who stay are not representative of the whole population. 

takes a long time 

## Sequential design
include elements of both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies 

## Ethnography 
focuses on the lived experience of people, usually as detailed by the research participants (also called “informants”) and as observed by the researcher
relies heavily on **participant observation**

## Cohort Design
longitudinal study in which researchers monitor and observe a chosen population over an extended period of time, **with no particular aim** 

Case study
        
Observation

Survey and Interview

Questionnaire


# Ethical Issues in Developmental Research
Informed Consent 
Protection of individuals' rights
Right to withdrawal
Debriefing
Confidentiality
Deception
