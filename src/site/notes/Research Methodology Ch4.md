**Statistics** - science - collecting, organizing, interpreting

**Norm** - Average
50% population

[[Averages#1. Mean\|Mean]] - a type of average where the sum total is divided by the number of elements


# Measurement
the process of assigning numbers or labels to units of analysis in order to quantify or categorize them. Measurement allows researchers to describe and compare their data using a common metric.

# Measurement Scales

-   **Nominal** measurement is the simplest form of measurement. It involves assigning labels or names to units of analysis without implying any order or magnitude. For example, assigning a number for a gender, 
-   **Ordinal** measurement involves assigning ranks or orders to units of analysis based on some criterion. It implies that there is a meaningful sequence among the categories, but not that the intervals between them are equal.
-   **Interval** measurement involves assigning numbers to units of analysis such that the intervals between them are equal and meaningful. It implies that there is a zero point, but not that it represents an absolute absence of the variable. For example, temperature
-   **Ratio** measurement involves assigning numbers to units of analysis such that the intervals between them are equal and meaningful, and there is a true zero point that represents an absolute absence of the variable. For example, sales, income, costs, age, and height are ratio variables.

**Reliability** (of a tool) refers to **consistency** of the tool.  The tool must give the same / similar results no matter how many tries / testing and retesting.  

**Validity** is the extent to which the tool measures what it is intended to measure 

standardization - making norms

**validity** is about the accuracy of a measure, i.e., how well it measures what it is supposed to measure.
**Reliability** is about the consistency of a measure, i.e., how well it produces the same results under the same conditions. A measurement can be reliable without being valid, but a valid measurement is usually also reliable. For example, if you use a broken thermometer to measure the temperature of a liquid sample several times, you might get the same reading every time (reliable), but it does not reflect the true temperature of the sample (invalid). On the other hand, if you use a working thermometer to measure the temperature of a liquid sample several times, you should get the same reading every time (reliable) and it should match the true temperature of the sample (valid).
