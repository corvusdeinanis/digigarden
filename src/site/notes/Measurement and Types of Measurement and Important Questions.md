1) Define measurement and types of measurement 
2) How to organize data
3) Explain **skewness** and **kurtosis**
	
	**Skewness** - whether a curve is symmetrical or asymmetrical; 
	How far data is scattered 
	In normal curve, mean, median, mode is the same
	(draw normal curve)

[[Normal Curve\|Normal Curve]]
[[Normal Distribution\|Normal Distribution]]
[[Negatively Skewed\|Negatively Skewed]]
[[Positively Skewed\|Positively Skewed]]

## Kurtosis

## Leptokurtic


## Mesokurtic


## Platykurtic 
Normal is extended more than 68%
More flat = Platykurtic
