# Theories of [[Senescence\|Aging]]
## Genetic Preprogramming theory of aging 
**[[Telomere\|Telomere]]** length reduces every time a cell divides
Telomere length = good marker of biological age
**built in time limit for reproduction of cells**

## Wear and tear theory of aging / Deterioration Theory / Fundamental Limitation Theory 
aging is caused by **progressive damage** to cells and body sysems
with time and use, mechanical functions decline

## Disengagement Theory of Aging 

## Activity Theory of Aging
