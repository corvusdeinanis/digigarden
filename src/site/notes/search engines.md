## What are they?
Search engines help us find content on the web. They have a vast database that is continuously updated. Depending on the key words, they return results that are relevant. Different search engines do this in different ways and rank the pages differently. 

## Processes involved 
### Crawling
Search engines have bots called "spiders" or "web crawlers" that are continuously scanning the Internet for content. 
### Indexing
This is the process of storing and organizing the websites and content that is crawled. 
### Ranking
This is where the engines rank the pages on the basis of certain criteria; different algorithms for different search engines. But all of them penalize spammy content, slow loading websites, bounce rate, suspicious activity or content, and so on.
