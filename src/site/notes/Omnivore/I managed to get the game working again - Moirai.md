Simply put, SQL is a language designed to manage databases ([learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)).

In databases, a query is basically a question or a petition, for example:

`Hey database, tell me how many users are registered on Reddit`.  
You are requesting the database to give you the number of registered users of Reddit.

Also you can store data instead of requesting data:

`Hey database, please save this comment on the r/Moirai subreddit`.  
At this point, you are storing this comment on the reddit database, so others users, like you, can read the comment later.

A real world query of the first example looks like this:  
`` SELECT COUNT(*) from `reddit`.`users`; ``

Also, a real world query of the second example looks like this:  
`` INSERT INTO `reddit`.`comments` (parent, comment) VALUES ('g2soais', 'Simply put, SQL is a (...)'); ``
