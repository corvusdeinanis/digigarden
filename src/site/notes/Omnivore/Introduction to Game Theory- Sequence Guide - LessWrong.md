# Introduction to Game Theory: Sequence Guide - LessWrong
#Omnivore

Special thanks to Luke for his book recommendation and his strong encouragement to write this.

Would you recommend The Art Of Strategy to people with an existing education in the subject? (\~2nd year undergraduate in my case).

I sometimes read introduction-to-something-I-already-know-quite-a-bit-about books so I can steal their explanations of introductory concepts (and also because a lot of them are entertaining in their own right), but in this case it looks like you've already done that for me.

I'll be curious to see what "10" is all about. 

> 1. Game Theory As A Dark Art

This entire sequence needs to be promoted into visibility.

Please back-link individual posts to this one.

Thank you for doing this! LessWrong needs more resources for people to learn basic useful math and quantitative reasoning. 

Also I hope my old [A Gentle Video Introduction to Game Theory](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/8nw/link%5Fa%5Fgentle%5Fvideo%5Fintroduction%5Fto%5Fgame%5Ftheory/) post would be useful to those seeking to learn about this topic. I know many LWers prefer text but those who don't might find the videos a fun approach. 

Thank you for doing this.
