# What is a research problem?

A research problem is a question that the research hopes to answer 
**specific issue or gap in existing knowledge**

posed in form of a question 
(contrast with hypothesis which is a tentative statement, an assumption)

# Why is research problem required? 
- it acts as **introduction** to the reader 
- provides framework 
- contextualizes 

# Characteristics 
1. Must be important or necessary
2. based on factual evidence (NOT HYPOTHETICAL)
3. Must be relevant 
4. suggests a meaningful method of resting hypothesis

Identify broad field -> Dissect the subareas -> selected interested sub-area -> raise research questions -> formulate objective -> Assess Objective -> Double Check

```


- decide interest area
- break it down to more specific areas
- Raise research questions
  how? impact? what does it do, etc
- Formulate the objective
  root objectives and sub-objectives
