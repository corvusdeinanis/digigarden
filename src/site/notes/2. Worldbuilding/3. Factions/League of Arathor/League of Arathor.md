The League of Arathor is a coalition of mostly humans that formed to fight back against the undead legions of the [[2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Defilers/Defilers\|Defilers]]. The League is led by [[2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/League of Arathor/High Paladin Erathenar\|High Paladin Erathenar]], a human paladin from the city of [[2. Worldbuilding/2. Regions/Todo/Trollbans Hold\|Trollbans Hold]].
The League's troops are mostly made up of human and elf paladins and archers, with a small number of dwarven warriors. They are well-equipped and highly trained, but they are outnumbered by the [[2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Defilers/Defilers\|Defilers]]' forces.
The Codex of the League of Arathor dictates that all members must fight to defend life and uphold justice. The paladins of the League are known for their bravery and righteousness, and they will stop at nothing to vanquish the [[2. Worldbuilding/3. Factions/Defilers/Defilers\|Defilers]] from [[2. Worldbuilding/2. Regions/The Basin\|The Basin]].
